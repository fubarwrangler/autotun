Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Just check out the repo and optionally initilize the iniread-submodule:

git submodule update --init

(cmake should do this for you if not yet)

Optionally create a build-directory and cd into it, then run cmake:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../

Next just do a make autotun or a make install and you should be fine.

Requirements
------------

You need cmake >= 2.8 to build, as well as libssh >= 0.5.2 (Fedora 17 has both)
